                About 26,000 sq km (18%) of Bangladesh is flooded by monsoons every year. At this time, especially in the northern part of the country, the Banavasi people are the victims of extreme misery. The As-Sunnah Foundation conducts relief activities every year
                in the flood-hit districts of the country and takes the initiative to stand by the needy and helpless people.
